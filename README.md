# rentflix
This was the final project for my CPS 278 (Java Spring Framework) class. The goals for this project were:
  
  1. Allow for the switching of customers
  2. Allow the addition of new movies
  3. Display all movies in the datebase
  3. Search for a movie using a keyword
  4. Allow a customer to checkout or return a movie
  5. Display checkout history for a particular customer
  6. Keep track of the available number of movie copies
  7. Use REST API to retrieve movie by title and checkout history by customerId
  
Note that this project utilized a manually configured Dispatcher Servlet (in constrast to spring boot), Spring MVC, Spring Rest, MySQL, Hibernate ORM mapping, a 3 layer architecture, JSP, JavaScript for asynchronous calls to the REST API, and JavaScript for the toggling of the user menu as well as displaying content.

The development of this specific project will halt but I will continue with the overall idea using a more modern project setup (Spring Boot).
